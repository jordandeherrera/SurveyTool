This is a survey tool that uses Shiny and shinyjs to take a dynamic list of questions and plot results as well as benchmark averages across respondents.

The survey is designed to run off of a question list based in CSV so that it can be changed as needed.  Hopefully, this makes the survey easily portable and used in a wide variety of applications.

The survey includes a validation script in which a respondent code must be entered prior to taking the surey.  This functionality can also easily be turned off.

The survey is designed to encourage respondents to add to a growing body of knowledge of the capabilities that different levels of industry have for a given field.  This is because respondents only get access to the summarized data once they complete the survey themselves.  The summarized data can then be used to tell a respondent how well they benchmark to similar peers based on market cap size and industry.
